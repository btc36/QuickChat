	Lincoln, I like the idea for Quick Chat and I want to join your team.
  It sounds like a creative application, and based on the reaction of the class, I think it would be popular with our college demographic.
  I like your business model plans, I agree that the focus should be on customer satisfaction and scale before monetization. 
  Your legal plans sound great, and I think I am a good fit for the technical priorities you listed. 
  I currently have a job as a web developer, so I am proficient in JavaScript. 
  I also have experience in React, Java and many more languages we could use. 
  I am willing to help with whatever aspect necessary, and I have the time to put in, whatever it may require. 
  I hope you’ll let me join the team, and I’m looking forward to working with you.
